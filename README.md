'Surrogate assisted active subspace and active subspace assisted surrogate - A new paradigm for high dimensional structural reliability analysis'
The repository provides MATLAB codes for the numerical examples illustrated in the paper ‘Surrogate assisted active subspace and active subspace assisted surrogate - A new paradigm for high dimensional structural reliability analysis’
Please go through the paper to understand the implemented algorithm.
Requirements:

1.Install UQlab package to run the file PCE_as (Which provides the Sparse PCE codes).

2.Four numerical examples are given separately in folders and named as
‘Example_1_Sobol_100’, ‘Example2_Composite_beam’,’ Example3_Truss’ and ‘Example4_Sixstorey_building.

3.Add the ‘H-PCFE_p’ folder to numerical example folders to run.
